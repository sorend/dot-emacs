This is for plain Emacs currently 28.x

Clone the repository as $HOME/.emacs.d/

No fancy stuff :-)

## What I want from my Emacs

I use IntelliJ for work Java coding, and Firefox for browsing. So I don't want my Emacs to do everything,
only what I need the most.

- Basic editing of text files
- Primary email -- notmuch + gnus-alias
- Python programming - lsp-mode
- LaTeX writing - auctex
- Org writing - TODO
